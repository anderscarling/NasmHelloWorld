# Hello World in NASM assembly for OS X (32 & 64 bit)

I won't promise this is done "the right way" (tm), I've never really
used assembly but wanted to play around with it some.
Everything seems to work under OS X Lion.

To assemble the 64 bit version you'll need to build your own nasm (use
homebrew).
